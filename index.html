          Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at McGill University.
          At McGill, I was also exposed to a lot of different perpectives and
          got to meet extremely intelligent people that I learned a lot from. I
          also tutor first year Computer Science courses here, and I'm a member
          of the Game Development club, and the McGill Artificial Intelligence
          soceity.

        <p class="Subtitle2">
          One month-long apprenticeship with ProgresSoft in Amman, Jordan. Here,
          I developed numerous skills and got to work alongside extremely
          talented people. I was introduced to front end technologies, such as
          HTML/CSS and Javascript, databases such as MySQL, how to set up
          servelts, APIs, and much more. I throoughly enjoyed the experience, as
          it gave me a small slice of what it would be like to work as a
          software developer.
