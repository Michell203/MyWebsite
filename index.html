    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    <p>I'm currently learning HTML and CSS, which is why now this website looks hideous.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping however to slowly start building this website from the ground up and make it look at least somewhat interesting.</p>
    <p>My goal for this website is to talk about myself; I will add to it my resume, presonal projects, and other miscellaneous stuff I find
    enjoyable.</p>
