          I am Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at McGill
          University. At McGill, I was also exposed to many different
          perspectives and met brilliant people from whom I learned a lot. I
          also used to tutor first-year Computer Science courses here, and I'm a
          member of the McGill GameDev club and the McGill Artificial
          Intelligence Society.

          I had a month-long apprenticeship with ProgresSoft in Amman, Jordan.
          Here, I developed numerous skills and got to work alongside highly
          talented people. I was introduced to and worked with front-end
          technologies, such as HTML/CSS and Javascript, databases such as
          MySQL, and learned how to set up servlets, APIs, and much more. I
          thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as it gave me a small slice of what
          it would be like to work as a software developer.
