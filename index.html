    <h1>Welcome to my page!</h1>
    <p>I'm currently learning HTML and CSS, which is why now this website looks hideous.</p>
    <p>I'm hoping however to slowly start building this website from the ground up and make it look at least somewhat interesting.</p>
    <p>My goal for this website is to talk about myself; I will add to it my resume, presonal projects, and other miscellaneous stuff I find
    enjoyable.</p>
    <p>My interests include <a href="https://steamcommunity.com/id/michel_hij/" target="_blank">video games</a>,
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/user/show/91181636-michel-hijazin" target="_blank">literature</a>,
      <a href="https://open.spotify.com/user/2xuuh4j8rk440b5l5g0vv1db2?si=3cd7c41e3df742ee" target="_blank">music</a>,
      and working out.

    <h2>Education</h2>

    <p>Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at McGill University. At McGill, I was also exposed to a lot of different perpectives and
      got to meet extremely intelligent people that I learned a lot from.
