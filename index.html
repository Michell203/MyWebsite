          I am Currently pursuing a degree in Computer Science at McGill
          University. At McGill, I was exposed to many different perspectives
          and met brilliant people from whom I learned a lot. I also used to
          tutor first-year Computer Science courses here, and I'm a member of
          the McGill GameDev club and the McGill Artificial Intelligence
          Society.

        <p class="Subtitle2">
          I had a month-long apprenticeship with ProgresSoft in Amman, Jordan.
          Here, I developed numerous skills and got to work alongside highly
          talented people. I was introduced to and worked with front-end
          technologies, such as HTML/CSS and Javascript, databases such as
          MySQL, and learned how to set up servlets, APIs, and much more. I
          thoroughly enjoyed the experience, as it gave me a small slice of what
          it would be like to work as a software developer.

        In my podcast, I bring a guest, and we talk for about 30 minutes. I've always wanted to start a podcast, 
        and I'm glad I finally did. From it, I want to connect with people and learn from them and their experiences while 
        developing my conversational skills.
